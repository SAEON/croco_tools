     Author : <b>L. Debreu, P. Marchesiello, G. Cambon, P. Penven</b><br>
     Category : <b>Release v2.1</b>, for more informations, 
     see <a href="user_manual/Doc_roms_agrif_v.2.1_190710.pdf">documentation</a> <br>
     Description:<b> This is the latest official ROMS_AGRIF release.</b> 
       <ul> <br>
         <li>AGRIF 2 way nesting with a full barotropic-baroclinic 2-way nesting.</li>
         <li>AGRIF allows MPI parallelization of nesting,
     in addition to added flexibility and portability. 
     In particular AGRIF executable conv (for generation of nested
code) is auto-configured and amr.in is now
     transparent to ROMS developments (AGRIF manages the include files 
     and variables to be interpolated).</li>
        <li>New RSUP3 advection/diffusion schemes for tracers to reduce diapycnal 
     diffusion along slopes.</li>
        <li>Online diagnostics are added for tracers and momentum equations</li>
        <li>New fields in outputs files: zonal and meridional wind stresses, wind speed, 
     heat fluxes.</li>
        <li>New bulk formulae for heat fluxes and wind stresses calculation (Fairall, 1996)</li>
	 
        <li>New biology models : NchlPZD, N2ChlPZD2, N2P2Z2D2</li>
        <li>New biogeochemical models : PISCES</li>

        <li>New parallelization optimization procesure : autotiling</li>
      </ul>

     Category : <b>Update v.2.0.1</b><br>
     Description:
       <ul>
     Change in subroutine UpdateGridhis, in zoom.F  : 
     call wrt_grid (ncidhis, hisname, lstr) replace by call wrt_his. In order to process
	 the writing of the parent updated grid, in history file ,
     at initilization,  in case of MPI mode parallelization and 2 way nesting. 
     Otherwise, in 2-way nesting and MPI, the update of the parent grid in history 
     NetCDF file at initialisation didn't work.<br />
     It was a bit dangerous, because the grid in the his.nc file was the original 
     one, created at the preprocessing phase, the  mask and h arrays  were not  
     updated by the child grid corresponding.In the case of reading the grid in this 
     his file, the mask and bathy were not the correct one and were different 
     from the average file ones. 
       </ul>
