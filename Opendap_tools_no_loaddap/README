Opendap_tools_no_loaddap

matlab scripts to be used only with matlab >= 2012a
To use these tools, a test on matlab version has to be satisfied :
    -->  ~verLessThan('matlab','7.14')

These scripts reproduce the old Opendap_tools behavior but 
they use built-in support for OPeNDAP from Matlab >= 2012a
see: http://www.opendap.org/user/jimg/blog/matlab_2012a
You do not need to install libdap and loaddap library.
Note that you can also access to local data.

getdap.m  : Download a data subsets from an OPENDAP server (or local data).
readattribute.m : Get the attribute of an OPENDAP dataset (or local data).
readdap.m : Reproduce the loaddods behavior; retry (100 times) 
            in case of network failure.
