	EDDY DETECTION TOOLBOX

Detect the geostrophic eddies from altimetry and ocean models
sea surface height (SSH).
Detection method : a combination of detecting the largest closed 
contours in SSH and the positive values of an Okubo-Weiss parameter. 
This require less tunable parameters in comparison to 
previous methods. This is usefull for the comparisons between 
different products, such as models and altimetry.

Use the different program files in the following order:

./DATA/rename_aviso.csh : 
create a link with Aviso SSH files with
standard names (such as /DATA/AVISO/madt_20100106.nc).

eddy_detect_aviso.m : 
Detect the eddies in a series of Aviso SSH 
files (such as /DATA/AVISO/madt_20100106.nc). Save the outputs in 
a NetCDF file.

eddy_detect_croco.m : 
Detect the eddies in a series of CROCO model 
solution files. Save the outputs in a NetCDF file.

eddy_select.m : 
Read the eddy NetCDF file. Select the eddies with
correct properties (minimum or maximum size, minimum amplitude).
Save the outputs in another NetCDF file.

eddy_tracking.m : 
Read the eddy NetCDF file and get from 1 time
step to the other the eddies which are the closest in terms of
spatial distance, shape or strength (i.e. minimizing a generalized
distance). This is the same eddy that have evolved in time.
This eddy will have the same ID number.
If this eddy travels at a unphysical speed. It is considered as 
an eddy which as disapeared and a new eddy is created (with
a new ID).

eddy_animate_aviso.m : 
Create an animation following the eddies
(mpeg, gif or fli format).

eddy_stats_eulerian_yearly.m : 
Compute the statistics of eddies 
for each year.  The statistics are made in an Eulerian approach:
counting all the eddies in one domain for each given time
(this is usefull to compare the energy of eddies with observed
eke from altimetry).

eddy_stats_lagrangian_yearly.m : 
Compute the statistics of eddies 
for each year.  The statistics are made in an Lagrangian approach:
each individual eddy is counted only once (even if it has a long 
duration).
