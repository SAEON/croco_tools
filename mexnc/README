MexNC 

MexNC is an interface between MATLAB and NetCDF files.  What's provided
here is the C code for building the mexnc mex-file on your platform as
well as several helper routines and wrappers.  The 2.0.x release is
known to be compatible with NetCDF versions 3.6.0-p1 and below.

Prior to release 2.0.0, the mex-file had the name "mexcdf53", the 53
coming from the fact that it was intended to work on Matlab 5.3 platforms.
On linux, this became further confused with the release of Matlab 6.0,
which would not work with mexcdf53 and required it's own build, which was
named mexcdf60.  The names are a bit clumsy, and as the release of the
new mex-file with support NetCDF-3 API approached, it was decided that
a name change was called for.  Wrapper routines called "mexcdf53.m" and
"mexcdf60.m" are provided for backwards compatibility.  These routines
do nothing except call mexnc with whatever arguments they themselves
were given.

If your platform is a common one, you may find an existing binary for
the mex-file at http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/downloads/index.html.  


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES
=======================================================================
The SGI mex-file fails two m-files in the test suite, "test_attput.m"
and "test_get_var_bad_param_datatype.m".  The code portions that fail
have to do with error handling, so rather than mexnc failing to 
execute good code, it is rather the case that mexnc does not fail
gracefully in those cases.  I do not have access to an SGI, so I 
unfortunately cannot debug this.



FILES PROVIDED
=======================================================================
This package provides the following files:

    AUTHORS:  
        people contributing mex file builds and source code.

    COPYING:  
        copyright notice.

    ChangeLog:  
        detailed changes in particular files in this module

    common.c mexgateway.c netcdf2.c netcdf3.c
        Source files.

    INSTALL:
        Installation notes.  For some platforms, this file isn't necessary.

    mex-files:
        Some platforms may be afforded more than one mex-file.  If the
        mex-file in this directory does not work for you, you might want
        to check this directory for other choices.

    makefile:  
        used to compile the mex-file.  Don't bother with this unless
        you need to compile your own build and you are NOT on windows.

    mexcdf53.m mexcdf60.m mexcdf.m
        Wrapper routines.  Used primarily for backwards compatibility.
        
    mexnc.m
        Help information for the mex-file.

    nc_hdf5_mode.m nc_lock_mode.m nc_noclobber_mode.m nc_nofill_mode.m
    nc_nowrite_mode.m nc_share_mode.m nc_write_mode.m
        Helper routines that provide the user with mnemonics
        for NetCDF open and creation modes.

    nc_double.m, nc_float.m, nc_int.m, nc_short.m, nc_byte.m, nc_char.m
        Convenience functions that supply the corresponding enumerated
        constants in netcdf.h

    mexnc_msvc71_st.bat, mexnc_msvc71_st_R11.bat
        Options files for building on the windows platform

    win32_make_mexnc.m
        M-file for invoking a win32 build.

        This file.

    tests
        This directory contains some scripts that will test your build
        of mexnc.  You need to execute the matlab script "test_mexnc"
        from within the tests directory.  Just about every function is
        tested at least once.   You don't need to bother with this unless
        you are compiling your own build.
