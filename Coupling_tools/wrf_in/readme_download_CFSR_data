- To get forcing for CROCO 
	- repeat steps 2 to 4 
	- for step 5, do not preselect anything on the Parameter presets menu, but select all necessary variables :  
#              Temperature
#              Latent heat flux
#              Sensible heat flux
#              Specific humidity
#              Precipitation rate
#              u-component of wind
#              v-component of wind
#              Downward shortwave radiation flux
#              Upward shortwave radiation flux
#              Downward longwave radiation flux
#              Upward longwave radiation flux

	- Click continue
	- Then for Output Format, click Converted to netCDF
	- Choose the following vertical levels:
#              Ground or water surface
#              Specified height above ground: 2 m
#              Specified height above ground: 10 m
	- In Gridded Products, choose:
#              6-hour Forecast
#              6-hour Average (initial+0 to initial+6)
	- Finally choose the grid: 0.312 x 0.312
	- Select a bounding box as in 7 if you want
	- Choose gzip compression option and submit your request
