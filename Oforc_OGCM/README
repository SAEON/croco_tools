make_OGCM.m is a way to get initial and boundary conditions
for CROCO simulations from different global oceanic models.
for the moment it works with SODA and ECCO. 
it uses DODS to extract the subgrids.

Now you can process oceanic frocing from the global daily glorys12 reanalysis
at 1/12 degree resolution.
It is distributed by copernicus/mecator =>  https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/

It use the python-motu client to download a space and time 
extraction of the reanalysis.
Have a look at the routines :
- download_mercator_frcst_python.m
- get_file_python_mercator.m
